	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>
		An electronic health record (EHR) is the systematized collection of patient and population electronically-stored health information in a digital format.A decade ago, electronic health records (EHRs) were touted as key to increasing of quality care. Today, providers are using data from patient records to improve quality outcomes through their care management programs. Combining multiple types of clinical data from the system's health records has helped clinicians identify and stratify chronically ill patients. EHR can improve quality care by using the data and analytics to prevent hospitalizations among high-risk patients.
		EHR systems are designed to store data accurately and to capture the state of a patient across time. It eliminates the need to track down a patient's previous paper medical records and assists in ensuring data is accurate and legible. It can reduce risk of data replication as there is only one modifiable file, which means the file is more likely up to date, and decreases risk of lost paperwork. Due to the digital information being searchable and in a single file, EMRs (electronic medical record) are more effective when extracting medical data for the examination of possible trends and long term changes in a patient.
